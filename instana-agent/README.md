# Instana

Instana is an [APM solution](https://www.instana.com/) built for microservices that enables IT Ops to build applications faster and deliver higher quality services by automating monitoring, tracing and root cause analysis. This solution is optimized for [Kubernetes](https://www.instana.com/automatic-kubernetes-monitoring/).

## Introduction

This chart adds the Instana Agent to all schedulable nodes in your cluster via a `DaemonSet`.

## Prerequisites

Kubernetes 1.9.x - 1.18.x

### Helm 3 prerequisites

Working `helm` with the `https://agents.instana.io/helm` repo added to your helm client.

### Helm 2 prerequisites

Working `helm` and `tiller`.

_Note:_ Tiller may need a service account and role binding if RBAC is enabled in your cluster.

## Installing the Chart

To configure the installation you can either specify the options on the command line using the **--set** switch, or you can edit **values.yaml**.

### Required Settings

#### Configuring the Instana Backend

In order to report the data it collects to the Instana backend for analysis, the Instana agent must know which backend to report to, and which credentials to use to authenticate, known as "agent key".

As described by the [Install Using the Helm Chart](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes#install-using-the-helm-chart) documentation, you will find the right values for the following fields inside Instana itself:

* `agent.endpointHost`
* `agent.endpointPort`
* `agent.key`

_Note:_ You can find the options mentioned in the [configuration section below](#configuration)

If your agents report into a self-managed Instana unit (also known as "on-prem"), you will also need to configure a "download key", which allows the agent to fetch its components from the Instana repository.
The download key is set via the following value:

* `agent.downloadKey`

### Zone and Cluster

Instana needs to know how to name your Kubernetes cluster and, optionally, how to group your Instana agents in [Custom zones](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/configuration/#custom-zones) using the following fields:

* `zone.name`
* `cluster.name`

`cluster.name` is required.
If you omit `zone.name`, the host zone will be automatically determined by the availability zone information provided by the [supported Cloud providers](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/cloud_service_agents).

### Optional Settings

#### Configuring Additional Backends

You may want to have your Instana agents report to multiple backends.
The first backend must be configured as shown in the [Configuring the Instana Backend](#configuring-the-instana-backend); every backend after the first, is configured in the `agent.additionalBackends` list in the [values.yaml](values.yaml) as follows:

```yaml
agent:
  additionalBackends:
  # Second backend
  - endpointHost: my-instana.instana.io # endpoint host; e.g., my-instana.instana.io
    endpointPort: 443 # default is 443, so this line could be omitted
    key: ABCDEFG # agent key for this backend
  # Third backend
  - endpointHost: another-instana.instana.io # endpoint host; e.g., my-instana.instana.io
    endpointPort: 1444 # default is 443, so this line could be omitted
    key: LMNOPQR # agent key for this backend
```

The snippet above configures the agent to report to two additional backends.
The same effect as the above can be accomplished via the command line via:

```sh
$ helm install -n instana-agent instana-agent ... \
    --repo https://agents.instana.io/helm \
    --set 'agent.additionalBackends[0].endpointHost=my-instana.instana.io' \
    --set 'agent.additionalBackends[0].endpointPort=443' \
    --set 'agent.additionalBackends[0].key=ABCDEFG' \
    --set 'agent.additionalBackends[1].endpointHost=another-instana.instana.io' \
    --set 'agent.additionalBackends[1].endpointPort=1444' \
    --set 'agent.additionalBackends[1].key=LMNOPQR' \
    instana-agent
```

_Note:_ There is no hard limitation on the number of backends an Instana agent can report to, although each comes at the cost of a slight increase in CPU and memory consumption.

#### Configuring a Proxy between the Instana agents and the Instana backend

If your infrastructure uses a proxy, you should ensure that you set values for:

* `agent.pod.proxyHost`
* `agent.pod.proxyPort`
* `agent.pod.proxyProtocol`
* `agent.pod.proxyUser`
* `agent.pod.proxyPassword`
* `agent.pod.proxyUseDNS`

#### Configuring which Networks the Instana Agent should listen on

If your infrastructure has multiple networks defined, you might need to allow the agent to listen on all addresses (typically with value set to `*`):

* `agent.listenAddress`

#### Agent Modes

Agent can have either APM or INFRASTRUCTURE.
Default is APM and if you want to override that, ensure you set value:

* `agent.mode`

For more information on agent modes, refer to the [Host Agent Modes](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent#host-agent-modes) documentation.

#### Installing with Helm 3

First, create a namespace for the instana-agent

```bash
kubectl create namespace instana-agent
```

To install the chart with the release name `instana-agent` and set the values on the command line run:

```bash
$ helm install instana-agent --namespace instana-agent \
--repo https://agents.instana.io/helm \
--set agent.key=INSTANA_AGENT_KEY \
--set agent.endpointHost=HOST \
--set cluster.name=CLUSTER_NAME \
instana-agent
```

#### Installing with Helm 2

To install the chart with the release name `instana-agent` and set the values on the command line run:

```bash
$ helm install --name instana-agent --namespace instana-agent \
--repo https://agents.instana.io/helm \
--set agent.key=INSTANA_AGENT_KEY \
--set agent.endpointHost=HOST \
--set cluster.name=CLUSTER_NAME \
instana-agent
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `instana-agent` release:

### Uninstalling with Helm 3

```bash
helm del instana-agent -n instana-agent
```

### Uninstalling with Helm 2

```bash
helm del --purge instana-agent
```

### Agent Configuration

Besides the settings listed above, there are many more settings that can be applied to the agent via the so-called "Agent Configuration File", often also referred to as `configuration.yaml` file.
An overview of the settings that can be applied is provided in the [Agent Configuration File](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/configuration#agent-configuration-file) documentation.
To configure the agent, you can either:

* edit the [config map](templates/configmap.yaml), or
* provide the configuration via the `agent.configuration_yaml` parameter in [values.yaml](values.yaml)

This configuration will be used for all Instana Agents on all nodes. Visit the [agent configuration documentation](https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/#agent-configuration-file) for more details on configuration options.

_Note:_ This Helm Chart does not support configuring [Multiple Configuration Files](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/configuration#multiple-configuration-files).

### Bring your own Keys secret

In case you have automation that creates secrets for you, it may not be desirable for this Helm chart to create a secret containing the `agent.key` and `agent.downloadKey`.
In this case, you can instead specify the name of an alread-existing secret in the namespace in which you install the Instana agent that carries the agent key and download key.

The secret you specify The secret you specify _must_ have a field called `key`, which would contain the value you would otherwise set to `agent.key`, and _may_ contain a field called `downloadKey`, which would contain the value you would otherwise set to `agent.downloadKey`.

## Changelog

### v1.1.8

* Update the README to replace all references of `stable/instana-agent` with specifically setting the repo flag to `https://agents.instana.io/helm`.
* Add support for TKGI and PKS systems, providing a workaround for the [unexpected Docker socket location](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release/issues/329).

### v1.1.7

* Store the cluster name in a new `cluster-name` entry of the `instana-agent` ConfigMap rather than directly as the value of the `INSTANA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME`, so that you can edit the cluster name in the ConfigMap in deployments like VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid in which, when installing the Instana agent over the [Instana tile](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/vmware_tanzu), you do not have directly control to the configuration of the cluster name.
If you edit the ConfigMap, you will need to delete the `instana-agent` pods for its new value to take effect.

### v1.1.6

* Allow to use user-specified memony measurement units in `agent.pod.requests.memory` and `agent.pod.limits.memory`.
  If the value set is numerical, the Chart will assume it to be expressed in `Mi` for backwards compatibility.
* Exposed `agent.updateStrategy.type` and `agent.updateStrategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable` settings.

### v1.1.5

Restore compatibility with Helm 2 that was broken in v1.1.4 by the usage of the `lookup` function, a function actually introduced only with Helm 3.1.
Coincidentally, this has been an _excellent_ opportunity to introduce `helm lint` to our validation pipeline and end-to-end tests with Helm 2 ;-)

### v1.1.4

* Bring-your-own secret for agent keys: using the new `agent.keysSecret` setting, you can specify the name of the secret that contains the agent key and, optionally, the download key; refer to [Bring your own Keys secret](#bring-your-own-keys-secret) for more details.
* Add support for affinities for the instana agent pod via the `agent.pod.affinity` setting.
* Put some love into the ArtifactHub.io metadata; likely to add some more improvements related to this over time.

### v1.1.3

* No new features, just ironing some wrinkles out of our release automation.

### v1.1.2

* Improvement: Seamless support for Instana static agent images: When using an `agent.image.name` starting with `containers.instana.io`, automatically create a secret called `containers-instana-io` containing the `.dockerconfigjson` for `containers.instana.io`, using `_` as username and `agent.downloadKey` or, if missing, `agent.key` as password. If you want to control the creation of the image pull secret, or disable it, you can use `agent.image.pullSecrets`, passing to it the YAML to use for the `imagePullSecrets` field of the Daemonset spec, including an empty array `[]` to mount no pull secrets, no matter what.

### v1.1.1

* Fix: Recreate the `instana-agent` pods when there is a change in one of the following configuration, which are mapped to the chart-managed ConfigMap:

* `agent.configuration_yaml`
* `agent.additional_backends`

The pod recreation is achieved by annotating the `instana-agent` Pod with a new `instana-configuration-hash` annotation that has, as value, the SHA-1 hash of the configurations used to populate the ConfigMap.
This way, when the configuration changes, the respective change in the `instana-configuration-hash` annotation will cause the agent pods to be recreated.
This technique has been described at [1] (or, at least, that is were we learned about it) and it is pretty cool :-)

### v1.1.0

* Improvement: The `instana-agent` Helm chart has a new home at `https://agents.instana.io/helm` and `https://github.com/instana/helm-charts/instana-agent`!
This release is functionally equivalent to `1.0.34`, but we bumped the major to denote the new location ;-)
