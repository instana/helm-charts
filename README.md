# Instana Helm Charts

This repository hosts the source of the Instana helm charts.
For now, it hosts just the `instana-agent` chart, formerly [hosted on Helm Hub](https://github.com/helm/charts), but we may move in sources of additional Helm charts as they become available.

You find these Helm charts on [![Artifact HUB](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://artifacthub.io/badge/repository/instana)](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?repo=instana)

## How to use these Charts

Each chart has its own `README.md` with instructions.
Additional information may be available in the [Instana documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=agents-installing-host-agent-kubernetes#install-by-using-the-helm-chart).
